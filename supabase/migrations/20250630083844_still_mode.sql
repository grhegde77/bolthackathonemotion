  # Fix user_profiles RLS policies for signup

  1. Problem Analysis
    - RLS policies are blocking profile creation during signup
    - The auth context may not be fully available during signup
    - Need to allow profile creation while maintaining security

  2. Solution
    - Simplify RLS policies to work with signup flow
    - Remove overly restrictive policies
    - Use a more permissive approach for INSERT during signup
    - Maintain security through proper policy design

  3. Security
    - Users can only create profiles with their own user ID
    - Users can only read/update their own profiles
    - Authenticated users can read other profiles for social features

-- Disable RLS temporarily to clean up
ALTER TABLE user_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing policies to start fresh

-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create simple, working policies

-- 1. Allow authenticated users to insert profiles (for signup)
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for authenticated users during signup"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- 2. Allow users to read their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own profile"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- 3. Allow users to update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- 4. Allow authenticated users to read other profiles (for social features)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read other profiles"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Clean up any existing orphaned profiles
DELETE FROM user_profiles 
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users
);
